# Changelog

## 2026-02-22

- Installer: make gum behavior fully automatic (interactive TTYs get gum, headless shells get plain status), and remove manual gum toggles.
- Installer: after macOS `node@22` Homebrew install, force-check active `node` major, print active `node`/`npm` paths, and fail with explicit PATH remediation if shell still resolves an older Node.
- Installer: strengthen npm failure diagnostics with parsed `code`/`syscall`/`errno`, exact install command, installer log path, npm debug log path, and first npm error line.
- CI/Tests: expand `install.sh` unit coverage for non-interactive gum disable, macOS Node PATH activation guard, and npm diagnostics parsing/output.
- Triage: close duplicate installer issue `openclaw/openclaw#23069` in favor of `openclaw/openclaw#23066` to keep ioctl troubleshooting centralized.

- Docs: rename README references from old Molt/Clawd names to OpenClaw/openclaw.ai and update Discord invite branding link (#57, thanks @knocte).
